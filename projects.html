									EasyScheduler -- Schedule Events Information Fusing and Processing Platform Project<br/>

									<br/>
									12/2010-06/2013
								<p>
									Developed the “One-Click Scheduler” software application in Java with self-designed algorithms, which can automatically extract date, time, location, theme and description from diverse Chinese texts in web pages, e-mails or other electronic documents, and then generate a standardized event in Google Calendar or Microsoft Outlook Calendar. We also built our own project website, and had a further plan to build “EasyScheduler” schedule events information fusing and processing platform, which can provide integrated services including not only schedule events search, subscription and publishing but also cloud calendar. This project was also called Suishouzhai in Chinese, and funded by China’s national finance with 20,000.00 RMB as a program of National Undergraduate Innovation Practice Plan. <br/>
